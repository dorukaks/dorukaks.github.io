This is still a bare-bones version of what I have in my mind. I think I did a considerably well job in integrating this template to myself but keep in mind that this is still a work in progress. More likely then not there will be bits and pieces lurking around from the template. If you spot any, <strong>please</strong> let me know…</p> <p>Slowly and ideally I will add some of my completed research projects over time and create a more holistic portfolio of my research for you. Once that is done, I will also start adding some informal blog posts on some of my “extracurricular” pleasures including travel posts, video game reviews and other less professional pieces.</p> <p>Building and maintaining this website will be one of my 2025 resolutions. Let’s see how consistent I will be.</p> <p>Happy holidays y’all!</p> <p>-DA</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="life-updates"/><category term="updates"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Finally the new webpage is ready]]></summary></entry></feed>
