Welcome to my new webpage. This is still a bare-bones version of what I have in my mind. I think I did a considerably well job in integrating this template to myself but keep in mind that this is still a work in progress. More likely then not there will be bits and pieces lurking around from the template. If you spot any, **please** let me know...

Slowly and ideally I will add some of my completed research projects over time and create a more holistic portfolio of my research for you. Once that is done, I will also start adding some informal blog posts on some of my "extracurricular" pleasures including travel posts, video game reviews and other less professional pieces.

Building and maintaining this website will be one of my 2025 resolutions. Let's see how consistent I will be.

Happy holidays y'all!
