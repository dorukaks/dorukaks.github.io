Hi! I'm Doruk (pronounced similar to "dough-rook", check [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KhOjVybXHM&t=2s) for how it actually sounds), a PhD student working with Alex Gorodetsky under Department of Aerospace Engineering at University of Michigan. I work on tensor decompositions, tensor networks and their appliactions in learning.

This website will (or should..) contain information on both my personal and professional life. I will try to keep this page as up-to-date as possible. You can find my talks, my publications and (if I'm not lazy) my hobbies here.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically. -->

<!-- Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
