Hi! I'm Doruk (pronounced similar to "dough-rook", check [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KhOjVybXHM&t=2s) for how it actually sounds), a PhD student working with Alex Gorodetsky under Department of Aerospace Engineering at University of Michigan. I work on tensor decompositions, tensor networks and their appliactions in learning.

This website will (or should..) contain information on both my personal and professional life. I will try to keep this page as up-to-date as possible. You can find my talks, my publications and (if I'm not lazy) my hobbies here

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
